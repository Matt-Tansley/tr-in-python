This project is my attempt at this coding challenge: https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-43-tr

The challenge is to create your own implementation of the `tr` command line utility. 

I have chosen to do this in Python as I would like to grow my Python experience.

# How To Run

I use Windows on my local machine, and Git Bash as a terminal. Python 3.12.1 is the version I had installed when 
running this.

Example of running the program in Git Bash:

```commandline
python tr.py c C 
```
